# Mystic T-Square

A (possible?) game.

OK, imagine a Tic-Tac-Toe board.  But rather than claiming squares based on order of choice, the player needs to answer a trivia question, to decide *who* claims the squre.

Isn't that just [**Hollywood Squares**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Squares)?

**Mystic T-Square** does bear some resemblance to the old game show, yes.  However, it expects only one player to answer questions.

Plus, the other player can slide the squares, like tiles in a 15-puzzle.  The other player gets that job.
